- 👋 Hi, We're @GooseIndustries
- 👀 We're interested in coding, AI, and anything computer-related
- 🌱 We're currently learning Python, C++
- 💞️ We're looking to collaborate on whatever is available
- 📫 How to reach us: GitHub, GooseIndustriesOfficial@outlook.com
- 😄 Pronouns: why do you wanna know??? were a team
- ⚡ Fun fact: Most people (people who wonder at least) think that we use VS code, or some other IDE. We use an IDE, yes, but not in a way you think. You see, the thing we did is: modded the hell out of Sublime Text to make it an IDE, it can run code on the press of ctrl+alt+n. Pretty nice actually, having that around. And also bragging rights: "We made Sublime Text an IDE"

GooseIndustries/GooseIndustries is a ✨ special (wait our team is special?) ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile
